	<h3>8    REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER CONTENT</h3>
	<p>Visitors may post reviews, comments and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions or other information, as long as the content is not illegal, obscene, abusive, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings or any form of "spam".  You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content.  We reserve the right (but not, in the absence of a valid Notice Form, the obligation) to remove or edit such content.  If you believe that any content on or advertised for sale on any Protos Service contains a defamatory statement, or that your intellectual property rights are being infringed by an item or information on any Protos Service, please notify us by completing and submitting the appropriate Notice Form and we will respond.</p>
	<p>If you post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant: (a) Protos a non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable and transferable rights to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media; and (b) Protos, its sublicensees and transferees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if they choose.  No moral rights are assigned under this provision.</p>
	<p>You agree that the rights you grant above are irrevocable during the entire period of protection of your intellectual property rights associated with such content and material.  To the extent permitted by law, you agree to waive your right to be identified as the author of such content and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such content.  You agree to perform all further acts necessary to perfect any of the above rights granted by you to Protos including the execution of deeds and documents, at our request.</p>
	<p>You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that, as at the date that the content or material is posted: (i) the content and material is accurate; and (ii) use of the content and material you supply does not breach any applicable policies or guidelines and will not cause injury to any person or entity (including that the content or material is not defamatory).  You agree to indemnify Protos for all claims brought by a third party against Protos arising out of or in connection with the content and material you supply except to the extent that any liability arises from our failure to properly remove the content when it is notified of the illegal nature of the content (Notice Form) arising out of or on the grounds of, or originating from the content that you have communicated to us.</p>
	<h3>9     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS</h3>
	<p>Protos respects the intellectual property of others.  If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been used in a way that gives rise to concerns of infringement, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Right Infringements.</p>
	<h3>10   PROTOS SOFTWARE TERMS</h3>
	<p>In addition to these Conditions of Use, the terms found here apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with Protos Services (the "Protos Software").</p>
	<h3>11    OTHER BUSINESSES</h3>
	<p>Parties other than Protos operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines on this website.  In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals or the content of their websites.  Protos does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all of these or any other third parties.  You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we may share your information related to those transactions with that third party.  You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.</p>
	<h3>12    PROTOS ROLE</h3>
	<p>Protos allows third party sellers to list and sell their products at Protos.co.uk.  In each such case this is indicated on the respective product detail page.  While Protos as a platform provider helps facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Protos platform, Protos is neither the buyer nor the seller of the seller's items.  Protos provides a venue for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete transactions.  Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion of a sale for these third party products is solely between buyer and seller.  Protos is not a party to this contract nor assumes any responsibility arising out of or in connection with it nor is it the seller's agent.  The seller is responsible for the sale of the products and for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue arising out of or in connection with the contract between the buyer and seller.  Because Protos wants the buyer to have a safer buying experience, Protos provides the Protos a-to-z guarantee in addition to any contractual or other rights.  For conditions relating to the sale by third parties to you on Protos.co.uk see the Participation Agreement.</p>
	<h3>13    OUR LIABILITY</h3>
	<p>We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the Protos Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be error-free.  However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be guaranteed.  Also, your access to Protos Services may also be occasionally suspended or restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or services.  We will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such suspension or restriction.</p>
	<p>Protos will not be responsible for (i) losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii) any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to both you and us when you commenced using the Protos Services.</p>
	<p>We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.  This condition does not affect your legal right to have goods sent or services provided within a reasonable time or to receive a refund if goods or services ordered cannot be supplied within a reasonable time owing to a cause beyond our reasonable control.</p>
	<p>The laws of some countries do not allow some or all of the limitations described above.  If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above limitations may not apply to you and you might have additional rights.</p>
	<p>Nothing in these conditions limits or excludes our responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or wilful misconduct.</p>
	<h3>14     APPLICABLE LAW</h3>
	<p>These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of France, and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the district of France City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions of Use in France or in the EU country in which you live.</p>
	<h3>15    ALTERATIONS TO SERVICE OR AMENDMENTS TO THE CONDITIONS OF USE</h3>
	<p>We reserve the right to make changes to any Protos Services, policies,  terms and conditions including these Conditions of Use, and Service Terms at any time.  You will be subject to the terms and conditions, policies and Conditions of Use in force at the time that you use the Protos Services.  If any of these Conditions of Use is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
	<h3>16    WAIVER</h3>
	<p>If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.</p>
	<h3>17     CHILDREN</h3>
	<p>We do not sell products for purchase by children.  We sell children's products for purchase by adults.  If you are under 18 you may use the Protos Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>

Furthermore, in submitting a Notice Form, you grant to Protos the right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, and display its content throughout the world in any media. This includes forwarding the Notice Form to the parties involved in the provision of the allegedly infringing content. You agree to indemnify Protos for all claims brought by a third party against Protos arising out of or in connection with the submission of a Notice Form.</p>

	<h3>20    NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFYING PROTOS OF DEFAMATORY CONTENT</h3>
	<p>Because millions of products are listed and many thousands of comments are hosted on Protos.co.uk, it is not possible for us to be aware of the contents of each product listed for sale, or each comment or review that is displayed.  Accordingly, we operate on a "notice and action" basis.  If you believe that any content on or advertised for sale on, the website contains a defamatory statement, please notify us immediately by completing and submitting a Notice.  Follow the instructions in the Notice and send a printed and signed copy to: Defamation Notices, Legal Department, c/o Patriot Court, 1-9 The Grove, Slough, Berkshire, SL1 1QP.</p>

	<h2>CONDITIONS OF SALE</h2>
	<p>These Conditions of Sale govern the sale of products by Protos EU SARL to you.  Protos.co.uk is a trading name of Protos EU SARL.  For conditions relating to the sale by third parties to you on Protos.co.uk see the Participation Agreement. We offer a wide range of Protos Services, and sometimes additional terms may apply.  When you use an Protos Service (for example Your Profile, Gift Cards or Protos applications for mobile), you will also be subject to the terms, guidelines and conditions applicable to that Protos Service ("Service Terms").  If these Conditions of Sale are inconsistent with the Service Terms, those Service Terms will control.</p>
	<p><span>Please read these conditions carefully before placing an order with Protos EU SARL.   By placing an order with Protos EU SARL, you signify your agreement to be bound by these conditions.</span></p>
	<h3>1    OUR CONTRACT</h3>
	<p>Your order is an offer to Protos to buy the product(s) in your order.  When you place an order to purchase a product from Protos, we will send you an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation E-mail").  The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered.  We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation E-mail"). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each Disptach Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail.  Your contract is with Protos EU SARL.  Without affecting your right of withdrawal set out in section 2 below, you can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.</p>
	<p>Please note that we sell products only in quantities which correspond to the typical needs of an average household. This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.</p>
	<h3>2     RETURNS</h3>
	<p>Please review our Returns Policy which applies to products sold by Protos.  In addition to your 30-days returns guarantee, customers in the European Union are entitled to a statutory withdrawal right of seven business days.  Details of this statutory right and an explanation of how to exercise it are provided in the order confirmation e-mail and in the Returns Policy.</p>
	<p>Protos does not take title to returned items until the items arrive at the returns address destination.  At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return.  In this situation, Protos does not take title to the refunded item.</p>
	<h3>3    PRICING AND AVAILABILITY</h3>
	<p>All prices are inclusive of legally applicable VAT.</p>
	<p>We list availability information for products sold by us on the website including on each product information page.  Beyond what we say on that page or otherwise on the website, we cannot be more specific about availability.  As we process your order, we will inform you by e-mail as soon as possible if any products you order turn out to be unavailable and you will not be charged for those products.</p>
	<p>Please note that unless otherwise stated on the website, delivery estimates are just that.  They are not guaranteed delivery times and should not be relied upon as such.</p>
	<p>Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalogue may be mispriced. We will verify pricing when processing your order and before we take payment.  If we have made a mistake and a product's correct price is higher than the price on the website, we may either contact you before shipping to request whether you want to buy the product at the correct price or cancel your order.  If a product's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and send you the product.</p>
	<h3>4    PRODUCT INFORMATION</h3>
	<p>Unless expressly indicated otherwise, Protos is not the manufacturer of the products sold on this website. While we work to ensure that product information on our website is correct, actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information to that displayed on our website. Ingredients may also change. All information about the products on our website is provided for information purposes only. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented on our website. Please always read labels, warnings and directions provided with the product before use.</p>
	<p>For healthcare products, in the event of any safety concerns or for any other information about a product, please carefully read the information provided with the product or contact the manufacturer. Content on this site is not intended to substitute for advice given by a medical practitioner, pharmacist or other licensed healthcare professional. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you suspect that you have a medical problem. Information and statements about products are not intended to be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or health condition. Protos accepts no liability for inaccuracies or misstatements about products by manufacturers or other third parties. This does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
	<h3>5    CUSTOMS</h3>
	<p>When ordering products from Protos for delivery outside of the EU you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination.  Any additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges.  Customs policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for further information.  Additionally, please note that when ordering from Protos, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the products.  Your privacy is important to us and we would like our international customers to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.  For more information see Customs Information.</p>
	<h3>6    1-CLICK ORDERING</h3>
	<p>1-Click ordering is the fastest and easiest way to order products safely and securely from Protos.  If you are using a public or shared computer terminal, we strongly recommend that you deactivate 1-Click ordering  when you are not at the computer.</p>
	<h3>7    OUR LIABILITY</h3>
	<p>Protos and its affiliates will not be responsible for (i) losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii) any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to both you and us when the contract for the sale of products by us to you was formed.</p>
	<p>The laws of some countries do not allow some or all of the limitations described above.  If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above limitations may not apply to you and you might have additional rights.</p>
	<p>Nothing in these conditions limits or excludes our responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or wilful misconduct.</p>
	<p>We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.  This condition does not affect your right to have the products sent to you within a reasonable time.  If the delay occurs before the products are dispatched, we will not charge you for the products until they are dispatched and you may cancel your order at any time prior to dispatch.</p>
	<h3>8    APPLICABLE LAW</h3>
	<p>These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of France, and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the District of France City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions of Sale in France or in the EU country in which you live.</p>
	<h3>9    AMENDMENTS TO THE CONDITIONS OF SALE</h3>

You will be subject to the terms and conditions, policies and Conditions of Sale in force at the time that you order products from us, unless any change to those terms and conditions, policies or these Conditions of Sale is required to be made by law or government authority (in which case it may apply to orders previously placed by you).  If any of these Conditions of Sale is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
